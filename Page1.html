<FONT face=arial COLOR=WHITE SIZE=5><B>There are thousands of spectacular monuments in the world.each of them have unique architectural  design
 and sculptural specialisation.people become mesmerised with the beauty of these monuments.But,it is very difficult to point out which 
is very most beautiful.Still, UNESCO has seven of these monuments as the 
"NEW SEVEN WONDERS OF THE WORLD". Various lists of the Wonders of the World have
been compiled from antiquity to the present day, to catalogue the world's most spectacular natural 
wonders and manmade structures.
<P>The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World is the first known list of the most remarkable creations
of classical antiquity; it was based on guidebooks popular among Hellenic sightseers and only includes works
located around the Mediterranean rim. The number seven was chosen because the Greeks believed it represented perfection and plenty, 
and because it was the number of the five planets known anciently, plus the sun and moon.</P>
